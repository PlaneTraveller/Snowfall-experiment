#+title: Snowfall Experiment

My experiments with declaritive systems using snowfall.

* Construction Site
** Nix plans
- [X] fix internet
- [X] How to activate snowfall? choose sys version?
- [X] installation workflow? maybe try on an existing system (vm) first
- [X] incorporate into snowflakes
- [ ] nixify laptop
- [X] use Just
- [ ] migrate to hyprland, get kde 6 working
- [ ] understand module system and custom options

** Nix stack
- [X] manage with git versions to enable rollback of =flake.lock=
- [X] fix git
- [X] loot! snowfall-starter
- [X] split config
- [X] modules hierarchy
- [X] figure out how Homes and Systems interact
- [X] try creating a working Homes + Systems
- [X] create 2 base cases for nixos modules and home modules, migrate to Homes
- [X] wm level stuff: sys or home? x/wayland
- [X] home: emacs
- [X] FIX PROXY!!!!!
- [X] sys: nvidia; home: git
- [X] think about what goes sys and what goes home
- [X] remove and fix conf.nix to make sure its working
- [X] watch emergent mind
- [X] determine whether or not to use flakes
- [X] try figuring out the architecture of sys config
- [X] users
- [X] Home?
- [X] fix ownership
- [X] create temporary hierarchy
- [X] know how to split configs
- [X] Home-system distinction
- [X] fall home: useful or not? what is it?
- [X] make emacs
- [X] write template
- [X] loot
- [X] fix proxy
- [X] learn how to use stable
- [X] disable default user in nixos
- [X] remake
- [X] restructure syncthing
- [X] fix proxychains
- [ ] templates
- [X] remake modules hierarchy
- [X] migrate and remove configuration.nix
- [X] emacs remake
- [ ] refactor! emacs, shell, direnv, just, etc
- [ ] rewrite README and refactor note structure
- [ ] desktop env remake
- [ ] laptop nix
- [X] make iso & plan
- [X] backup plan: snapshot to usb? refactor usb? any ways to keep it around? windows?
- [X] dirty install/ dirty + temporary disko/ pure clean
- [X] write disko config (follow guide on disko page, just copy repo and src_sh{nixos-generate-config --root /mnt & nixos-install})
- [X] design usb use
- [X] get nushell
- [X] misc packages

* Learning Nix
- [[https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf][Original Thesis]]
* Modules hierarchy
*** Necessary
- home
- user
- hardware
- system

*** Apps
- services
- apps
- tools
- desktop

* Installation
** Stack
- [X] preferred way to install? by snowfall & flake
- [X] disko: dual boot? migrate existing setup? different for different systems?
- [X] nixos-anywhere
- [X] just dirty-install!
- [X] get unstable iso
- [X] write Outpost config
- [X] understand and try writing a good btrfs boilerplate disko file w. automation. If not easy, just manually partition
- [ ] how ioga's conf work? what's behind the install? the precedure? build iso?
** Disko
- lvm-vg
- btrfs
- My decision is: No swap!
- An article about swap: https://chrisdown.name/2018/01/02/in-defence-of-swap.html
** Deploy
*** Tools
- deploy-rs
- nixos-anywhere
- kexec
- nixos-generators
- https://github.com/IogaMaster/blizzard

*** How
- kexec: basically load another kernal (the installer)
- nixos-generators: to generate a kexec image
- nixos-anywhere: autoinstall
- deploy-rs: auto check for deployment (ssh stuff)
- Testing:
#+begin_src bash
nix build ./#nixosConfigurations.HOSTNAME.config.system.build.installTest -L
#+end_src
*** I locked myself out.

- [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/766048/mount-unknown-filesystem-type-lvm2-member][LVM problem]]
- just reinstall in the iso (sign)

*** Note
- Need root access & password at new machine
#+begin_src bash
nix run .#install -- <hostname> <ip-address>
#+end_src
- the ping will never stop, and the hostname is not ~nixos~
- manually change the ip and hostname! Need to provide root password!
